# Data Structures and Algorithms Course Assignment (7)
## MazeSolver
Solving Mazes given in a text file with DFS and BFS algorithms in java

## Explanation
You should be able to find the path from the startcell to the goal cell using the path findingalgorithms. The user can specify how he would liketo solve the maze using DFS or BFSalgorithm and you should output the path he shouldfollow..You need to implement the following interface. Ifthere is any errors in the file, or in thepassed parameter, then you should throw an exception.Coordinates indexes are zero based.
