# MazeSolver
Solving Mazes given in a text file with DFS and BFS algorithms in java            


• Given File Format : txt file named map -> map.txt
• the user has to choose the prefered method of solving whether DFS (Depth First) or BFS (Breadth First).
• the input format :
  • you should input the size of the maze in the first line in the map on the form <row> <column>
  • you should draw your maze on the form
     -> 'S' denoting the starting point of the maze. 
     -> 'E' denoting to the End point of the maze.
     -> '.' which will be points that you are free to move through.
     -> '#' which will be blocks "you can't move through".
   • example to the maze input in map.txt file :
      5 5 
      S...#
      ##.##
      #...#
      .E.##
• the output format : 
  • the path illustrated in the map.
  • vertices of steps to be followed on that map.
